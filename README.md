# Credit-Card-Transaction-Fraud-Detection-Supervised-Learning-Imbalanced-Dataset

#INTRODUCTION
This Project was from my one of the classes from USC Marshall School of Business, DSO 562 - Fraud Analytics. Credit card fraud is a burden for organizations across the globe. Specifically, $24.26 billion were lost due to credit card fraud worldwide in 2018, according to shiftprocessing.com. In this project, our goal was to build an effective and efficient model to predict transaction fraud.
