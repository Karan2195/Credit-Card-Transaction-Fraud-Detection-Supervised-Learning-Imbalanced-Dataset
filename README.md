# INTRODUCTION

This Project was from my one of the classes from USC Marshall School of Business, DSO 562 - Fraud Analytics. Credit card fraud is a burden for organizations across the globe. United States is the most credit card fraud prone country in the world. According to Federal Trade Commissionâ€™s (FTC), instances of credit card fraud in the US increased by 44.6% from 271,927 in 2019 to 393,207 in 2020 which resulted in a loss of approximately 3.3 billion dollars. Credit card fraud also accounted for 393,207 of the nearly 1.4 million (~28.08%) reports of identity thefts in 2020. Through this report, our goal was to build and highlight efficient model to predict fraud.
